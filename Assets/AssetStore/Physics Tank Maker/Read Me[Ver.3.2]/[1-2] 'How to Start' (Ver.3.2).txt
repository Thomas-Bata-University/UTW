*** How to Start ***
(1) Create a new project, and import this package from Asset Store.
	Create a new project using Unity 2018.4 or later.
	And import this package from Asset Store.
	Window >> Asset Store >> "My Assets".

(2) Setup the "Build Settings".
	We need to setup the "Build Settings" to play the demo scenes.
		1. Open the "Build Settings" window.
			File >> Build Settings...

		2. Find the demo scenes in the "Demo_Scenes" folder.

		3. Drag and drop all the scenes into the "Scenes In Build".
  
(3) Setup the "Project Settings".
	We need to setup the "Project Settings" to use all the features in this project, such as the use of a gamepad.
		1. Find a Zip file named "ProjectSettings" in the "Read Me[Ver.3.x]" folder.

		2. Open the directory of the ZIP file.
			You can open the directory of the file by right-clicking on it,
			and choosing "Show in Explorer"(Win) or "Show in Finder"(Mac).

		3. Unzip the ZIP file, and copy the following files in it.
			* "DynamicsManager"
			* "InputManager"
			* "TagManager"
  
		4. Find the "ProjectSettings" folder to overwrite the default settings.
			You can open the directory of the folder by right-clicking on the "Assets",
			and choosing "Show in Explorer"(Win) or "Show in Finder"(Mac).
			And open the "ProjectSettings" folder.

		5. Paste the three files into the "ProjectSettings" folder, and overwrite the old ones.

		6. Make sure the settings has been updated.
			Edit >> Project Settings >>
			* >> "Input"
				Make sure several inputs has been added in the "Input".

			* >> "Physics"
				Make sure the "Layer Collision Matrix" is updated in the  "Physics".
  
			* >> "Tags and Layers"
				Make sure several layers has been added in the "Tags and Layers".

(4) Change the "Color Space" to "Linear".
	The demo scenes were created in Linear Color Space, so their light settings are too bright in Gamma Color Space.
	Please change the color space in the "Player Settings".
	Edit >> Project Settings >> Player
	Change the "Color Space" value to "Linear" in the "Other Settings".
  
(5) Play the demo scenes.
	You can find the demo scenes in the "Demo_Scenes" folder.
	I recommend you to first play the demo scene "01_Operation_Tutorial".


*** About to the Sky Boxes ***
The Sky Boxes in the demo videos and games are included in "Standard Assets for Unity 4.6".
However the package has been deprecated from the Asset Store.
If you have downloaded it before, you can import it from the "My Assets" in the "Asset Store" window.
